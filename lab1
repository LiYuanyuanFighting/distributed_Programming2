# Exercises for refreshing Java programming

### These exercises are about the use of files, collections and dates/times in Java. The solutions to these
exercises are not to be submitted.

- Be careful about the file extension maybe hidden, like the mistake I made:
dictionary.txt.txt

- the default path for the input file should be inside javaRefresh
